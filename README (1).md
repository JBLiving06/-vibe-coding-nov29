# Vibe Coding Workshop: ChatGPT's 3rd Birthday Edition 🎂

**November 29, 2025 | Broganda Community Session**

## What is This?

On ChatGPT's third birthday (November 30, 2022 → November 30, 2025), the Broganda community gathered for a live demonstration of "vibe coding" — the practice of building functional software through natural language conversation with AI models.

Three AI models were given identical prompts. Three different solutions emerged. All of them work.

## 🔗 Live Tools

### AI Career Navigator

## The Models

| Model | Provider | Approach |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Claude Opus 4.5** | Anthropic | Meta-recursive (calls Claude API at runtime for fresh analysis) |
| **GPT-5.1** | OpenAI | Offline expert system with 3,000+ lines of embedded knowledge |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | Google | React-based with embedded data and clean component architecture |

## The Tools

### 1. AI Career Navigator
Evaluate any career path against AI automation risk. Get personalized advice based on your career stage.

| Version | File | Approach |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Claude (Recommended)** | `claude-ai-career-navigator.html` | Makes live API calls to Claude for unlimited career analysis |
| ChatGPT | `chatgpt-ai-career-pathfinder.html` | Embedded expert system with 13 domain profiles |
| Gemini | `gemini-ai-career-navigator.html` | React component with embedded 50+ career database |

### 2. Sandwich Generation Calculator
Map the financial pressure of supporting aging parents and launching adult children simultaneously.

| Version | File | Approach |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Claude (Recommended)** | `claude-sandwich-calculator.html` | Actuarial-grade modeling with health progression simulation |
| ChatGPT | `chatgpt-sandwich-calculator.html` | Clean interface with configurable cost-of-living multipliers |
| Gemini | `gemini-sandwich-calculator.html` | React component with interactive bar chart visualization |

## Quick Start

1. Download any `.html` file
2. Open it in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. No installation, no dependencies, no server required

That's it. This is the magic of vibe coding — functional tools that work immediately.

## Why Claude Won

All three models produced working tools. But Claude's implementation best matched the original prompt requirement:

> "Build tools that work immediately without requiring the user to have any technical knowledge."

**Claude's advantage:** The artifacts feature. Claude generates shareable HTML files that work with one click. ChatGPT and Gemini produced code that required users to:
- Save files manually
- Navigate file systems
- Potentially configure local servers

For a group of 50+ year-olds exploring AI for the first time, Claude's approach removed all friction.

## Architectural Differences

### AI Career Navigator

**Claude:** Makes runtime API calls to `api.anthropic.com`. Can analyze ANY career with fresh, contextual advice. Requires internet connection.

**ChatGPT:** Embedded ~3,000 lines of domain expertise across 13 industry profiles. Works offline. Limited to pre-defined career categories.

**Gemini:** Embedded database of 50+ specific careers. Works offline. Falls back to generic analysis for unlisted careers.

### Sandwich Generation Calculator

**Claude:** Simulates health decline probabilities. Models care cost inflation. Identifies peak pressure years.

**ChatGPT:** Clean form-based input. 15-year projection. Monthly cost breakdown tables.

**Gemini:** React-based interactive charts. Real-time updates as you adjust inputs. Peak year analysis.

## The Broganda Context

Broganda is a community of professional men in their early 50s who met through yoga and now support each other through career transitions, family challenges, and navigating the AI era.

This workshop demonstrated that:
- You don't need to be a programmer to build software
- AI has democratized software creation
- The "sandwich generation" challenge is real and quantifiable
- Career planning in the AI era requires new mental models

## What is Vibe Coding?

"Vibe coding" is the practice of building software by describing what you want in natural language and letting AI handle the implementation. It's characterized by:

- **Natural language prompts** instead of syntax
- **Iterative refinement** through conversation
- **Focus on outcomes** rather than code structure
- **Rapid prototyping** of functional tools
- **Democratized development** for non-programmers

The term gained traction in 2024-2025 as AI coding assistants became sophisticated enough to build complete applications from descriptions.
